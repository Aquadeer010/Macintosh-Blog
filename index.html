        <h3>"Macintosh" era
        </h3>
        <h4>During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Apple witnessed the rise and fall of several groundbreaking computer models. The Apple II gained immense popularity in education circles but faced stiff competition from the IBM PC after its introduction in 1981, leading Apple to develop the Lisa, a pioneering system that incorporated a graphical user interface. However, the Lisa's high price and limited software availability led to commercial failure. Parallelly, the Macintosh project, envisioned as an affordable and user-friendly computer for the masses, was initiated. Despite an initially revolutionary launch, the early Macintosh faced performance issues and lacked applications, causing fluctuations in sales. Nevertheless, its impact on popularizing the graphical user interface, WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) concept, and desktop publishing was significant. Apple's strategic decisions, high pricing, and resistance to licensing the Mac OS led to missed opportunities, hindering the Macintosh's potential as the dominant computing platform. Subsequent developments, including the Macintosh LC and PowerBook series, attempted to rectify these issues, achieving some success, but Apple faced challenges from competitors like Microsoft's Windows, impacting its market share drastically. Eventually, the acquisition of NeXT in 1996 marked a turning point, bringing Steve Jobs back to Apple and paving the way for future innovations.

        <h3>Steve Jobs Era 
        </h3>
        <h4>During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Apple underwent a transformative period under the leadership of Steve Jobs, marked by significant developments in hardware, software, and design philosophy. Acquiring NeXT, Apple integrated NeXTSTEP's advanced capabilities and object-oriented programming tools into its operating system strategy, leading to the creation of Rhapsody and eventually the modern Mac OS X, introducing features like Aqua GUI, Unix stability, and preemptive multitasking. Jobs' return as CEO brought a strategic overhaul, focusing on design, usability, and product simplification. The iconic iMac G3, with its unconventional design and innovative features like USB ports and CD drives, became a commercial triumph, revitalizing Apple's image and marking a shift towards consumer-oriented computing. The "Apple New Product Process" emphasized collaborative development and design-centric approaches, seen in subsequent successful products like the iBook and PowerBook G4, characterized by colorful translucent plastic and innovative features like Wi-Fi connectivity. Apple's foray into digital lifestyle, with applications like iTunes, iPhoto, and iMovie, integrated Macs into users' daily lives, setting the stage for the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, eventually leading to the company's rebranding as Apple Inc. This period marked a resurgence for Apple, positioning it as a pioneer in design-centric computing and digital lifestyle integration.

            <h3>Macintosh 128K
            </h3>
            <p>The Apple Macintosh—later rebranded as the Macintosh 128K—is the original Apple Macintosh personal computer. The Macintosh was the first successful mass-market all-in-one desktop personal computer with a graphical user interface, built-in screen, and mouse. It played a pivotal role in establishing desktop publishing as a general office function. The motherboard, a 9 in (23 cm) CRT monitor, and a floppy drive were housed in a beige case with integrated carrying handle; it came with a keyboard and single-button mouse. It sold for US$2,495 (equivalent to $7,000 in 2022).

            <h3>Ipad - Gen 1
            </h3>
            <p>The first generation of iPad was announced on January 27, 2010,[18] and pre-ordering began on March 12.[19] Initial reaction to the product name, which struck many women as a menstrual pun "indicative of a male-helmed team oblivious" to the connotations, mocked it.[20][21]

              A Wi-Fi-capable version was released in the United States on April 3 and a 3G-capable version was released on April 30.[22] Apple released iPad models internationally on May 28, July 23, and September 17. The first iPad has a 1 GHz Apple A4 central processing unit (CPU) with 256 megabytes (MB) of random access memory (RAM) and a PowerVR SGX535 graphics processing unit (GPU). It has four buttons; a home button that directs the user to its homepage, a wake-and-sleep button, and two volume-control buttons. Its multi-touch-based display has a resolution of 1,024 by 768 pixels.
